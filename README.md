Bum - Bun Version Manager

<sup><sub>(logo will be generated later by DALL-E 3 x ChatGPT, if you have ChatGPT Plus, please generate for me! )</sup></sub>

Introducing Bum, a bun version manager.  
Built in Rust from scratch.
There are many improvement, but I can say it's really fast to use!

Commands:
- `bum use <version>`
   - This will automatically install if there's no target version in saved in the local and then use that version
   - If exists, it will use that version as active version.

Bum release is WIP. For now you have to have Cargo installed.
