Bum - Bun Version Manager

Introducing Bum, a bun version manager.  
Built in Rust from scratch.
There are many improvement, but I can say it's really fast to use!

Commands:
- `bum use <version>`
   - This will automatically install if there's no target version in saved in the local and then use that version
   - If exists, it will use that version as active version.
