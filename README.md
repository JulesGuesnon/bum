Bum - Bun Version Manager

<sup><sub>(logo will be generated later by DALL-E 3 x ChatGPT, if you have ChatGPT Plus, please generate for me! )</sup></sub>

Introducing Bum, a bun version manager.  
Built in Rust from scratch.
There are many improvement, but I can say it's really fast to use!

Bum initial version is released! You can download it from [releases page](https://github.com/owenizedd/bum/releases)
Currently the installing process will be improved, but for now you have to download the executable manually.

Commands:
- `./bum use <version>`
   - This will automatically install if there's no target version in saved in the local and then use that version
   - If exists, it will use that version as active version.

Any contribution is appreciated.
